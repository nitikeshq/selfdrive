## Overview
This document details the comprehensive features implemented for DriveEase, including guest checkout, admin verification workflow, document uploads, and post-booking activities.

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Guest Checkout System ‚úÖ
**Allows users to book vehicles without registration using only email and phone number**

#### Database Schema Updates
- Added guest booking fields to `bookings` table:
  - `isGuestBooking`: Boolean flag to identify guest bookings
  - `guestEmail`: Email address for guest bookings
  - `guestPhone`: Phone number for guest bookings
  - `guestName`: Guest customer name
  - `userId`: Made nullable to support guest bookings

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/bookings` - Now supports both authenticated and guest bookings (NO authentication required for guests)
  - For authenticated users: Include `userId`
  - For guest users: Include `isGuestBooking: true`, `guestEmail`, `guestPhone`, `guestName`
  - Validates that either userId OR all guest fields are provided
- `GET /api/guest-bookings?email={email}` - Retrieve bookings by guest email

#### How It Works
