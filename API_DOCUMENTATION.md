- **completed**: Booking period ended
- **cancelled**: Cancelled by user

### Payment Status

## Payment Integration

### PayU Marketplace Model
- **Platform Commission**: 30% of booking amount
- **Owner Earnings**: 70% of booking amount
- **Split Payment**: Automatic settlement to owner's PayU vendor account after 7 days
- **Payment Gateway**: PayU (test/production environments)

### Payment Flow
1. Create booking (status: pending, paymentStatus: pending)
2. Call `/api/create-payment` with booking details
3. Get PayU payment data with hash
4. Redirect user to PayU payment page
5. PayU redirects to success/failure callback
6. Update booking status based on payment result

---

## Object Storage

### Google Cloud Storage Integration
- **Authentication**: Replit sidecar service
- **Required Environment Variables**:
  - `PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS`: Comma-separated GCS paths for public files
  - `PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR`: GCS path for private files (DL photos, etc.)

### File Upload Flow
1. Call `/api/objects/upload` to get pre-signed URL
2. Upload file directly to GCS using the URL
3. Call `/api/dl-photos` to set ACL if file is private
4. Store returned object path in database

### ACL System
- **Public**: Readable by anyone
- **Private**: Readable only by owner
- Permissions: READ, WRITE

---

## Business Logic

### Booking Cancellation Policy
```javascript
const hoursUntilStart = (startDate - now) / (1000 * 60 * 60);

if (hoursUntilStart >= 72) {
  // 3+ days: 100% refund minus 2% processing fee
  refundAmount = totalAmount - (totalAmount * 0.02);
} else if (hoursUntilStart >= 24) {
  // 1-3 days: 80% refund
  refundAmount = totalAmount * 0.8;
} else {
  // < 24 hours: 60% refund
  refundAmount = totalAmount * 0.6;
}
```

### Vehicle Availability Check
A vehicle is available if:
1. Not paused (`isPaused = false`)
2. No active bookings overlapping requested dates
3. Booking status is not 'cancelled'

### Platform Commission Split
```javascript
const PLATFORM_COMMISSION_RATE = 0.30; // 30%
platformCommission = totalAmount * 0.30;
ownerEarnings = totalAmount * 0.70;
```

---

## Additional Endpoints

### Challans (Traffic Violations)
```
POST /api/challans
GET /api/challans/vehicle/:vehicleId
GET /api/challans/booking/:bookingId
```

### Vehicle Documents
```
POST /api/vehicle-documents
GET /api/vehicle-documents/:vehicleId
```

### Owner Addresses
```
POST /api/owner-addresses
GET /api/owner-addresses/:ownerId
PATCH /api/owner-addresses/:id

```

### Video Verifications
```
POST /api/video-verifications
GET /api/video-verifications/:bookingId
PATCH /api/video-verifications/:id/approve
```

---

## Error Handling

All endpoints return standard HTTP status codes:
- **200**: Success
- **201**: Created
- **204**: No Content (successful deletion)
- **400**: Bad Request (validation errors)
- **401**: Unauthorized (no session)
- **403**: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- **404**: Not Found
- **500**: Internal Server Error

Error response format:
```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "message": "Detailed message"
}
```

For validation errors (Zod):
```json
{
  "error": [
    {
      "path": ["fieldName"],
      "message": "Validation message"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Session Management

### Cookie-based Authentication
- Cookie name: `connect.sid`
- HttpOnly: true (prevents XSS)
- Secure: true (in production, HTTPS only)
- SameSite: Lax
- Max Age: 7 days

### For Native Apps
Since native apps can't use browser cookies:
1. After login/register, store the session cookie from response headers
2. Include cookie in subsequent requests:
   ```
   Cookie: connect.sid=s%3A...
   ```
3. Or implement token-based auth (requires backend modification)

---

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Session
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key

# PayU Payment Gateway
PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY=your-merchant-key
PAYU_SALT=your-salt-key

# Object Storage
PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS=gs://bucket/public
PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR=gs://bucket/private

# App URL
REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN=https://your-app.replit.app
```

---

## Next Steps for Native App Development

1. **Authentication**: Implement cookie/session handling or switch to JWT tokens
2. **API Client**: Create a REST client with base URL configuration
3. **State Management**: Use Redux/MobX/Context for managing user session
4. **File Uploads**: Implement multipart upload to GCS using pre-signed URLs
5. **Payment Integration**: Integrate PayU SDK for mobile payments
6. **Real-time Updates**: Consider WebSocket for live booking updates
7. **Offline Support**: Cache vehicle data and implement sync mechanism
